        <h2>What's Really Happening</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 25px;"><strong>You are a master of strategy, but a novice in your own emotional life.</strong></p>
        
        <p>You can close a deal, but you can't close the distance between you and your partner. The same armor that protected you on the climb is now isolating you at the top. You feel profoundly alone, surrounded by people who only see your status, not your soul.</p>
        
        <h3>If any of these are true, your emotional life is running on an outdated script:</h3>
        
        <ul class="problem-list">
            <li>You feel a constant pressure to "perform" even in your most intimate relationships.</li>
            <li>You struggle to process difficult emotions like grief, anger, or fear, often defaulting to numbness or control.</li>
            <li>You find yourself over-reacting to small triggers from your partner or children.</li>
            <li>You worry that people only like what you give them, not who you really are.</li>
            <li>You feel disconnected from your own body, treating it like a machine to be optimized.</li>
            <li>You are successful, but the quiet lack of fulfillment is becoming deafening.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="cost">
        <h2>What It's Really Costing You</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.15em;">The cost is not measured in dollars, but in the erosion of your most valuable human assets: genuine connection and internal peace.</p>
        
        <p>Your inability to be fully present means you are missing the moments that truly matter. The emotional distance you maintain is a self-imposed ceiling on your happiness.</p>
        
        <div class="callout">
            You are sacrificing the depth of your life for the breadth of your success. This isn't a failure of character; it's a failure of your internal system to shift from a survival-driven state to a connection-driven state.

        <h2>The Shift: From Emotional Isolation to Unshakeable Intimacy</h2>
        
        <ul class="benefit-list">
            <li><strong>Emotional Literacy:</strong> Process difficult emotions with clarity and ease, without defaulting to control or avoidance.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentic Relationships:</strong> Create deep, felt connections where you are seen and valued for who you are, not what you do.</li>
            <li><strong>Grounded Presence:</strong> Show up fully present for your family, partner, and team, leading with attunement.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal Fulfillment:</strong> Replace the constant striving with a profound, quiet sense of being enough.</li>
            <li><strong>Somatic Freedom:</strong> Release the chronic tension and anxiety stored in your body, allowing for genuine relaxation.</li>
            <li><strong>True Authority:</strong> Lead from an internal sense of security, not external validation or status.</li>

        <h2>Why This Is Different</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.15em;">We don't just talk about feelings.</p>
        
        <p>We use <strong>Somatic Inquiry and Emotional Attunement Practice</strong> to re-pattern the deep-seated emotional responses stored in your body. This work bypasses the over-thinking mind and teaches you how to listen to your body's wisdom.</p>
        
        <p>The result is a <strong>permanent shift in your capacity for intimacy and emotional resilience</strong>, allowing you to connect authentically without the need for performance.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        
        <div>
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"Is this therapy?"</strong>
                <div>No. This is a structured, presence-based inquiry focused on re-patterning your nervous system for sustainable leadership. We focus on the present moment, not clinical diagnosis.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"Is this spiritual/woo?"</strong>
                <div>No. This is grounded in evidence-based somatic methods (like Compassionate Inquiry and IFS) that address the body's physiological response to stress. It is practical and results-oriented.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"Will this take a lot of time?"</strong>
                <div>The program is 3 months. The daily practice is designed to integrate into your life, not consume it. We focus on quality of presence, not quantity of time.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"I'm functional, just stressed—do I need this?"</strong>
                <div>Functionality under stress is a high-cost operation. This work is for those who want to move from functional to effortless—to lead from a state of comfort, not anxiety.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"I've tried coaching/therapy before."</strong>
                <div>This is different because it is somatic. We bypass the over-thinking mind and work directly with the body's intelligence, which is where the patterns are stored.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"What if my problem is physical pain?"</strong>
                <div>Your pain is a message. We treat somatic symptoms as a direct communication from your nervous system, using inquiry to address the emotional roots of the chronic tension.</div>
            </div>
