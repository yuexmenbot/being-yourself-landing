        <h2>What's Really Happening</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 25px;">You've been trying to solve "stress" with more thinking, more planning, and more control. But <strong>you can't think your way out of a nervous system response</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>What looks like "lack of ownership," "overreacting," or "burnout" is actually your body doing what it learned to do: protect you. You are running on an invisible operating system shaped by old "ammunition"—past triggers that turn a simple Slack message or a KPI dashboard into a perceived threat.</p>
        
        <h3>If any of these are true, your "Survival Adaptations" are now your biggest costs:</h3>
        
        <ul class="problem-list">
            <li><strong>Perfectionism</strong> is rewarded as "high standards," but it's actually a terror of being seen as incompetent.</li>
            <li><strong>Overwork</strong> is praised as "drive," but it's a frantic attempt to seek safety through action.</li>
            <li><strong>People-Pleasing</strong> is seen as "easy to work with," but it's a fear of disconnection and shame.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Shutdown</strong> is called "professionalism," but it's a nervous system in freeze, blocking your creativity.</li>
            <li>You feel <strong>"foggy and triggered"</strong> in meetings, losing access to your best problem-solving brain.</li>
            <li>You've mastered the external game, but you're <strong>"spilling the milk" internally</strong> every single day.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section id="cost">
        <h2>The Real Cost</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.15em; color: #E89B7E;"><strong>When your nervous system is in defense, you lose access to your higher brain structures.</strong></p>
        
        <p>You are literally paying a tax on your intelligence. The cost is paid in impulsive emails, avoidant leadership, and a "viral nature of negativity" that drains your team's bandwidth.</p>
        
        <p><strong>You are sacrificing your potential and your peace for a version of success that is actually a survival state.</strong> If you don't solve the "Safety Problem," you will never solve the "Performance Problem."</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="promise">
        <h2>The Shift: From Survival-Driven Effort to Regulated Presence</h2>
        
        <ul class="benefit-list">
            <li><strong>Access Your Higher Brain:</strong> When the body feels safe, clarity, creativity, and ethical influence become your default.</li>
            <li><strong>Interrupt the Loops:</strong> Learn to sense activation—tight chest, urge to rush, numbness—and regain choice in real-time.</li>
            <li><strong>End the Blame Cycles:</strong> Treat activation as information, leading to more ownership, honesty, and repair in your team.</li>
            <li><strong>Effortless Productivity:</strong> Stop "thinking harder" and start leading from a state of "neutral" power where skills work naturally.</li>
            <li><strong>The "Travel Feeling" Anywhere:</strong> Unburden your mind from chronic thinking to find peace in the middle of the storm.</li>
            <li><strong>Trauma-Sensitive Mastery:</strong> Dismantle the adaptations that once protected you but now imprison your growth.</li>

        <h2>Why This Is Different</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.15em;">We don't give you more "behavior management" tools. <strong>We address the Source: The Autonomic State.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Using <strong>Compassionate Inquiry and Somatic Re-patterning</strong>, we help you identify the "ammunition" you've been carrying. We teach you and your team how to signal safety through tone, pacing, and responsiveness.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 20px; background: #F2ECE4; border-left: 4px solid #E89B7E; border-radius: 10px;">This isn't "soft"—it's strategic. We create the conditions where people can think, feel, and relate without being hijacked by survival states.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="objections">
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"Is this therapy?"</strong>
                <div>No. This is a strategic inquiry into how nervous system states drive workplace performance. We focus on regulation and clarity, not clinical diagnosis.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"Is this 'soft' or 'woo'?"</strong>
                <div>No. It is based on polyvagal theory and neurobiology. Safety is the gateway to the higher brain structures required for complex problem-solving. It's a competitive advantage.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"Will this take a lot of time?"</strong>
                <div>The workshop is 2 hours; the individual journey is 3 months. The shift in state actually saves time by reducing mistakes, blame cycles, and avoidant behavior.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"I'm functional, just stressed—do I need this?"</strong>
                <div>Functionality in a survival state is a high-cost operation. This work moves you from functional to effortless—where you lead from comfort, not anxiety.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"I've tried coaching before."</strong>
                <div>Most coaching focuses on behavior. We focus on the state that drives the behavior. If the nervous system feels under threat, no amount of coaching will stick.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"What if my problem is just a 'difficult' team member?"</strong>
                <div>"Difficult" is often a nervous system seeking safety through action or disconnection. We teach you how to shift the environment so they can access their best selves.</div>
