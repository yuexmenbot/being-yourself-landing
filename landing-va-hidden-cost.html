        <h2>What's Really Happening</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 25px;"><strong>You are functionally successful.</strong> You have the status, the business, and the lifestyle that everyone else wants. But internally, you are not okay.</p>
        
        <p>You feel a profound sense of isolation, as if you are performing in your own life. Your relationships feel shallow—driven by what you can provide or the status you hold, rather than who you really are. You quietly wonder if anyone truly sees you, or if they just like the security you provide.</p>
        
        <h3>If any of these are true, your internal system is in chronic red alert:</h3>
        
        <ul class="problem-list">
            <li>You can't "switch off" at night, no matter how successful the day was.</li>
            <li>You experience chronic tension, migraines, or gut issues that doctors can't fully explain.</li>
            <li>You find yourself over-reacting to small triggers at home or in the boardroom.</li>
            <li>You feel a constant, low-grade anxiety that no amount of achievement can silence.</li>
            <li>You are tired of optimizing and fixing, yet the internal pressure never stops.</li>
            <li>You feel alone at the top, surrounded by people but disconnected from genuine intimacy.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="cost">
        <h2>The Cost You're Paying</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.15em;">The drive that built your success has become a predicament.</p>
        
        <p>What was once your greatest asset—your ability to push, strive, and achieve—is now the very thing blocking you from a fruitful, fulfilled path. This isn't about "fixing" your high-achiever nature; it's about recognizing that your current driver is running on an outdated script.</p>
        
        <div class="callout">
            The cost is a life that looks perfect on the outside but feels hollow and exhausting on the inside. You are sacrificing your health and your deepest human connections for a version of success that no longer nourishes you.

        <h2>The Shift: From Striving to Sustainable Impact</h2>
        
        <ul class="benefit-list">
            <li><strong>Decision Clarity:</strong> Access deep, grounded wisdom instead of reactive, anxious thinking.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Steadiness:</strong> Maintain calm and presence when the market or team is in chaos.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentic Relationships:</strong> Move beyond shallow interactions to deep, seen, and felt connections.</li>
            <li><strong>Somatic Relief:</strong> A significant reduction in chronic tension, pain, and stress responses.</li>
            <li><strong>True Authority:</strong> Lead from an internal sense of security, not external validation or status.</li>
            <li><strong>Effortless Being:</strong> Experience the comfort of being yourself, without the need to perform.</li>

        <h2>Why This Is Different</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.15em;">This is not therapy, coaching, or another self-help hack.</p>
        
        <p>We use <strong>Presence-Based Somatic Inquiry</strong> to systematically dismantle the unconscious stress-response patterns that keep you cycling between high performance and internal depletion.</p>
        
        <p>We don't try to fix you; we teach you how to listen to the truth your body is already holding. The result is a <strong>permanent re-patterning of your nervous system</strong>, leading to a new default state of grounded competence.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        
        <div>
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"Is this therapy?"</strong>
                <div>No. This is a structured, presence-based inquiry focused on re-patterning your nervous system for sustainable leadership. We focus on the present moment, not clinical diagnosis.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"Is this spiritual/woo?"</strong>
                <div>No. This is grounded in evidence-based somatic methods (like Compassionate Inquiry and IFS) that address the body's physiological response to stress. It is practical and results-oriented.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"Will this take a lot of time?"</strong>
                <div>The program is 3 months. The daily practice is designed to integrate into your life, not consume it. We focus on quality of presence, not quantity of time.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"I'm functional, just stressed—do I need this?"</strong>
                <div>Functionality under stress is a high-cost operation. This work is for those who want to move from functional to effortless—to lead from a state of comfort, not anxiety.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"I've tried coaching/therapy before."</strong>
                <div>This is different because it is somatic. We bypass the over-thinking mind and work directly with the body's intelligence, which is where the patterns are stored.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="objection-row">
                <strong>"What if my problem is physical pain?"</strong>
                <div>Your pain is a message. We treat somatic symptoms as a direct communication from your nervous system, using inquiry to address the emotional roots of the chronic tension.</div>
            </div>
